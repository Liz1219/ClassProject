Make a clear statement of a single guiding/research question that will drive your analysis.â€¯It should be phrased as a question that you will try to investigate (i.e., it should have a question mark). 

### Become acquainted with your data sources: 
Where did you find them? 
Who collected/maintains them? 
When and why were they originally collected? 
What does a case represent in each data source, and how many total cases are available? 
What are some of the variables that you plan to use?
